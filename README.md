# ANN_Handwritten_to_Digits

 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for handwritten digit recognition involves:

1. **Dataset**: Dataset of handwritten digits (MNIST).
2. **Preprocessing**: Resize and normalize images.
3. **Model**: Design a ANN architecture for better performance.
4. **Training**: Train the model using the dataset, adjusting weights to minimize errors.
5. **Validation**: Validate model performance to tune hyperparameters.
6. **Testing**: Test the model on a separate dataset to assess its accuracy.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for inference on new handwritten digits.
